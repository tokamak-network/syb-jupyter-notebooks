    "# SYB scoring algorithm Demo-Notebook: Personalized PageRank Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Personalized PageRank** algorithm, which provides a more scalable approach to approximating the results of the Equal Split algorithm. It leverages personalized PageRank vectors to define scores for each node. The scoring function is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph $G$ and a score vector $x$, to compute the new score $y_i$ for a vertex $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Compute the personalized PageRank vector, $pr(\\alpha, u_i)$, where $u_i$ is a unit vector with a 1 at position $i$.\n",
    "2.  Create a permutation of all nodes by sorting them in descending order based on their PageRank scores.\n",
    "3.  For each $j$ from 1 to $n$, define the subset $S_j$ as the first $j$ nodes in this sorted permutation.\n",
    "4.  The new score $y_i$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = \\min\\limits_{j: i \\in S_j, x_{S_j} < \\frac{1}{2}x_V}\\frac{|\\partial S_j|^\\sigma}{|S_j|}.\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids iterating through all possible subsets, making it feasible for larger graphs than the Equal Split algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- On input two values, $n=$ N_VERTICES and $m=$ M_EDGES, it generates a random graph ($G$) over $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.\n",
    "- It initializes a vector $x$ of non-negative score values as the normalized degree of each vertex, then computes the next score values of the nodes using the personalized PageRank-based formula (if the graph is totally disjoint, it initializes the scores uniformly as $1/n$).\n",
    "- It plots the graph with initial and updated values.\n",
    "- It then prompts the user to add an edge between two vertices.\n",
    "    - If the edge already exists, it asks for another pair.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, it adds the edge, computes the new scores, and plots the updated graph with the new values."
