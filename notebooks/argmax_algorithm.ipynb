    "# SYB scoring algorithm Demo-Notebook: Linear Programming Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Linear Programming (Argmax) Algorithm**, which computes new scores by optimizing over a specific polytope. This approach is useful for theoretical analysis as it finds a provably optimal score vector that is as 'close' as possible to the old scores, while maximizing the total score sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new score vector $y$ is defined as the unique vector with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $y \\in \\argmax_{y' \\in P_{G,x}} \\sum_{i} y'_i$\n",
    "2.  $y_V = x_V$\n",
    "3.  $||y-x||$ is minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{G,x}$ is the polytope defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{G,x} = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^V : y_S \\leq |\\partial S|^\\sigma \\text{ for all } S \\text{ such that } x_S < \\frac{1}{2}x_V\\}.\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is solved in two steps using optimization algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A **linear program** finds a vector $y'$ that maximizes the sum of its components over the polytope $P_{G,x}$.\n",
    "2.  A **quadratic program** then finds a vector $y$ that minimizes the Euclidean distance $||y-x||$ while satisfying the linear constraints and the new constraint that its components sum to the maximum value found in Step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:** This algorithm has exponential complexity, making it extremely slow for graphs with more than about 10 vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- On input two values, $n=$ N_VERTICES and $m=$ M_EDGES, it generates a random graph ($G$) over $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.\n",
    "- It initializes a vector $x$ of non-negative score values as the normalized degree of each vertex, then computes the next score values using the optimization-based formula (if the graph is totally disjoint, it initializes the scores uniformly as $1/n$).\n",
    "- It plots the graph with initial and updated values.\n",
    "- It then prompts the user to add an edge between two vertices.\n",
    "    - If the edge already exists, it asks for another pair.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, it adds the edge, computes the new scores, and plots the updated graph with the new values."
