    "# SYB scoring algorithms Demo-Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to give an hand-on introduction to the problem of devising **Sybil-resistant scoring algorithms** in a graph network. In this context, the network is represented as an undirected graph $G = (V(G), E(G))$, where vertices are users and edges signify that two users have vouched for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of these algorithms is to assign a score to each user that reflects their trustworthiness and resistance to Sybil attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Sybil attack is a type of attack where a single malicious entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to gain a disproportionate influence in a system. The algorithms compute a new score vector, $y$, from an existing score vector, $x$, to evaluate a user's standing within the network: would these algorithms counteract such attacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "# SYB Scoring Algorithms: A Comparison of a few algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide an overview of four different scoring algorithms; detailed demonstrations can be found in separate notebooks, where one can test hands-on if a scoring algorithm is Sybil-resistant or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "All algorithms are implemented to work with a graph $G = (V(G), E(G))$, where vertices $V(G)$ represent users and edges $E(G)$ signify a mutual vouching relationship. A **score vector** $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{|V(G)|}$ assigns a non-negative score to each user.\n",

    "### 1. Random Walk Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is based on a simple random walk approach. The new score for a user is determined by the scores of their neighbors, weighted by the degree of those neighbors. It's an intuitive approach where a user's score is a function of the scores of the users who vouched for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: The new score $y_i$ for vertex $i$ is given by:\n",
    "$$y_i:=\\sum\\limits_{(j,i)\\in E(G)}\\frac{x_j}{\\deg(j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Behavior**: The code generates a random graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It initializes the score vector $x$ uniformly as $[1/n, 1/n, \\ldots, 1/n]$. The algorithm then computes the new scores using the formula and plots the graph with both initial and updated values. It prompts the user to add an edge, and if a new edge is added, it recomputes and plots the updated scores.\n",

    "**Further details**: [Random walk scoring algorithm](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tokamak-network/syb-jupyter-notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Frandom_walk_scoring_algorithm.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Equal Split Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Equal Split algorithm calculates new scores by finding the minimum value of a specific ratio over certain subsets of the graph. This approach serves as a theoretical benchmark for more scalable algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: The new score $y_i$ for a vertex $i$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$y_i = \\min\\limits_{S: i \\in S, x_S < \\frac{1}{2}x_V}\\frac{|\\partial S|^\\sigma}{|S|}$$\n",
    "**Complexity**: This algorithm has **exponential complexity**, making it impractical for graphs with more than approximately 18 vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Behavior**: The code generates a random graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It initializes the score vector $x$ as the normalized degree of each vertex (or uniformly if the graph is disjoint). It then computes the new scores, plots the graph, and allows the user to add a new edge, recomputing and replotting the scores if the graph is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further details**: [Equal split scoring algorithm](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tokamak-network/syb-jupyter-notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fequal_split_algorithm.ipynb).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Personalized PageRank Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Personalized PageRank algorithm is a more scalable approximation of the Equal Split algorithm. Instead of iterating through all subsets, it leverages personalized PageRank vectors to define scores, making it feasible for larger graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: The new score $y_i$ for a vertex $i$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$y_i = \\min\\limits_{j: i \\in S_j, x_{S_j} < \\frac{1}{2}x_V}\\frac{|\\partial S_j|^\\sigma}{|S_j|}.$$\n",
    "Here, $S_j$ is a subset of nodes based on a sorted permutation derived from the personalized PageRank vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship to Equal Split**: This algorithm provides a practical and scalable way to approximate the results of the Equal Split algorithm, which is otherwise too computationally expensive for large graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Behavior**: The code generates a random graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It initializes the score vector $x$ as the normalized degree of each vertex (or uniformly if the graph is disjoint). It then computes the new scores, plots the graph, and allows the user to add a new edge, recomputing and replotting the scores upon update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further details**: [Pagerank scoring algorithm](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tokamak-network/syb-jupyter-notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fpagerank_algorithm.ipynb).\n",

    "### 4. Linear Programming (Argmax) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm computes scores by optimizing over a specific polytope using linear and quadratic programming. It is primarily used for theoretical analysis to find a provably optimal score vector that is as 'close' as possible to the old scores while maximizing the total score sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: The new score vector $y$ is the unique vector that satisfies three properties:\n",
    "1. $y \\in \\argmax_{y' \\in P_{G,x}} \\sum_{i} y'_i$\n",
    "2. $y_V = x_V$\n",
    "3. $||y-x||$ is minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity**: Like the Equal Split algorithm, this one also has **exponential complexity**, making it extremely slow for graphs with more than 10 vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Behavior**: The code generates a random graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It initializes the score vector $x$ as the normalized degree of each vertex (or uniformly if the graph is disjoint).
